# Do's and Don'ts of BCML

## Do's

-   **Do** use the backup and restore feature. Besides offering safety and convenience,
    you can also use it as a way to run different mod "profiles."
-   **Do** read the tooltips throughout the UI for helpful information, especially when
    picking game folders.
-   **Do** read the [Troubleshooting](help.html?page=troubleshooting) page first if you
    have problems.
-   **Do** use the "Copy to Clipboard" icon button on the error dialog when reporting
    errors.
-   **Do** consider supporting my work on
    [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/nicenenerdbcml) and reading
    [my blog](https://calebdixonsmith.wordpress.com).
-   **Do** confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord and believe in your heart
    that God raised Him from the dead.

## Don'ts

-   **Don't** use BCML alongside other methods of installing mods in Cemu. While the
    community graphic packs (e.g. FPS++, Resolution, Clarity, etc.) and code patches
    (always marked as such on GameBanana) work fine, mods that alter game files will
    usually conflict with BCML's master merge. This usually will cause bugs and/or
    crashes.
-   **Don't** report issues just by saying something "doesn't work." Be specific about
    what mods you have, which platform you use, your BCML version, etc.
-   **Don't** expect all mod combinations to work properly. Some will always break.
-   **Don't** use NSFW mods.
